## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [bun](https://bun.sh/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SudarshanaSRao/sports-on-the-go-4c575e84.git
   cd sports-on-the-go-4c575e84
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   bun install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   
   The project uses Lovable Cloud (Supabase) for backend services. The `.env` file is auto-configured when deployed through Lovable, but for local development, you'll need:
   
   ```env
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
   ```

4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   bun run dev
   ```

5. **Open your browser**
   
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to see the application running.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The following diagram illustrates the system architecture and data flow of SquadUp:

![SquadUp Architecture](docs/architecture-diagram.png)

### Architecture Overview

SquadUp follows a modern client-server architecture with the following key components:

- **Client Side**: React frontend built with Vite and TypeScript, handling user interactions and UI rendering
- **Authentication Context**: Manages user authentication state with email and Google OAuth support
- **Content Moderation**: Edge function that filters user-generated content for safety
- **Geocode Function**: Edge function that converts addresses to coordinates for map display
- **Row Level Security**: PostgreSQL database with RLS policies ensuring secure data access
- **Core Database Tables**:
  - **profiles**: Stores user profile information
  - **games**: Stores game details and statistics
  - **rsvps**: Manages event attendance
  - **communities**: Auto-created for each game
  - **reviews**: Player ratings and feedback

### Data Flow
1. **User Authentication**: Users sign up/login via Lovable Cloud Auth (email or Google)
2. **Game Creation**: Host creates game → Geocode function validates address → Game stored in database
3. **Game Discovery**: Users browse games → Map displays locations → Filter by sport/skill level
4. **RSVP System**: User joins game → RSVP recorded → Player count updated → Community auto-created
5. **Social Features**: Friend requests → Accepted friendships → Enhanced game visibility
6. **Review System**: Post-game reviews → Ratings calculated → User profiles updated
